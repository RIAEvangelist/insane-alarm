# Online & Offline Alarm Chrome App
This is a desktop port (nw.js) of my very first chrome app programmed one night when my wife was away. I had spent a night out with the boys and drank a bit too much but needed to be up in the morning. I realised that my phone was dead and I didn't have a charger, and my internet was unreliable at the time so none of the apps out there seemed like they would wake me up reliably.

So I naturally did what any programmer would do, I programmed my own, with the LOUDEST alarm based off of an emergency alarm from when I was in the military. I couldn't find a good sound to match it in my intoxicated state... so I made my own using the Web Audio Context and Oscillator nodes.

It supports Windows, Mac and Linux.
